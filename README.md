# CDF Creator

Welcome! I created this application to help with my final year project. I needed to create CDF graphs for a bunch of data.

This application lets you created a CDF graph for each .csv file found, as long as the .csv file has the word 'latency' in one of its headings. 

*Maybe in the future I'll update it to allow user to customise which files to create CDF of and what headings.*

## Installation

To install the application in development mode just fork this repository then follow the steps:

1. Run `npm start`
2. Make your changes
3. Press `cmd + r` or `ctrl + r` to reload the application
4. Voila!

## Build

To build the application just run `npm run build`.

*This only works for darwin x64 OS, to configure it for your OS you can edit the command in the package.json file - this page [here](https://github.com/electron/electron-packager) should hopefully help.*

Enjoy!
